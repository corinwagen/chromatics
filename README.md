## Description

*chromatics* is a simple Python library for analyzing chromatographic data.

*chromatics* is designed to allow for simple analysis of SFC-MS data. In particular, *chromatics* simplifies analysis of overlapped chromatographic peaks by using modern non-linear curve fitting algorithms (as implemented in *lmfit*) to fit the observed chromatogram to a linear combination of parametric peak models.

## Installation

```
pip install chromatics
```

## Tutorial

For an example of how to use *chromatics*, see ``tutorial/``.
